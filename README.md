# Prodigy-DataScience-Internship
This repo contains 5 tasks completed during my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech. I worked on real-world data projects, applied ML concepts, and built practical skills in data analysis and visualization. Grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow through this hands-on experience.
